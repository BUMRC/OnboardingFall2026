"""Monte Carlo localization: a particle filter over the rover's pose (x, y, yaw) in the map.

Every update moves the particles by the change in odometry (motion model), weights them by how well
the scan fits the map from each particle's pose (sensor model), and resamples when the weights get
uneven. You write the four functions above ParticleFilter; ParticleFilter ties them together.
