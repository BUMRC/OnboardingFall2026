"""MPPI (model predictive path integral) control: follow the path fast without hitting anything.

Every control step: add noise to the current plan of commands to get many candidate plans, simulate
each one, score the trajectories, and average the candidates, weighting the good ones heavily.
You write rollout(), trajectory_cost() and mppi_weights(); MPPI.step() ties them together.
